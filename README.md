## Scala | Enumeration

An enumerations serve the purpose of representing a group of named constants in a programming language. Scala provides
an **Enumeration** class which we can extend in order to create our enumerations.

**Important points of enum** :

- In Scala, there is no enum keyword unlike Java or C.
- Scala provides an Enumeration class which we can extend in order to create our enumerations.
- Every Enumeration constant represents an object of type Enumeration.
- Enumeration values are defined as val members of the evaluation.
- When we extended the Enumeration class, a lot of functions get inherited. ID is one among the them.
- We can iterate the members.
